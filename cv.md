3) I have no experience in IT yet, but I am ready to show a high level of self-organization in order to become a good employee. I have a great desire to develop, and I am ready to show this in practice. During the upcoming training, I want to master all the "basics" of this profession and become a full-fledged employee, working for the prosperity of the company. Any experience in this position will be very valuable to me. In my work, self-development is most valuable for me - career growth and self-awareness as a professional. In my personal life, I am interested in sports, healthy lifestyle and creativity.
I would be very glad to have the opportunity to become an IT professional and will do my best to justify your trust!  
Best regards, Traskovskiy Ivan Sergeevich.
